Caching disabled explicitly for extract.

Step extract has started.

By default, the PandasMaterializer stores data as a .csv file. If you want to store data more efficiently, you can install pyarrow by running 'pip install pyarrow'. This will allow PandasMaterializer to automatically store the data as a .parquet file instead.

Step extract has finished in 0.603s.
