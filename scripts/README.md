## Installing dependencies

Make the script executable, give the script execution rights: \
chmod +x scripts/install_requirements.sh

To install dependencies, use the following script:
```bash
./scripts/install_requirements.sh
```

To automate taking data and validation you can use test_data.sh
```bash
./scripts/test_data.sh <path_to_csv> <tag_name> <branch of git>
```
